	<h2>Rules</h2>
	
	<p>
		<h3>Setup</h3>
		The game is played on a 4×4 grid. The middle four pieces are initially controlled by the second player.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Turns</h3>
		Each turn, a player may move a piece and take an action if possible.<br>
		The first player must move a piece before taking an action. The second player must use an action before moving a piece.
		This means that on the first turn, the player cannot move a piece at all.
	</p>

	<p>
		<h3>Moving</h3>
		A piece can be moved to any of the up-to-eight neighboring tiles.<br>
		Whenever a player places or moves a piece, the player takes control of the tile that the piece is placed or moved onto.<br>
		A player may not move a piece onto another piece.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h3>Actions</h3>
		Actions require the player to own a certain configuration of tiles in order to be used.<br>
		Currently, the only action is placing a new piece, which can be used if the player controls two adjacent tiles or on the first turn.<br>
		A piece may only be placed on a neutral tile or a tile the player owns, but not on the opposing player's tiles.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h3>Winning</h3>
		A player wins by having four pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
